<h2>Welcome to the Gamer's Toolkit 2.0 Preview!!</h2>

<p>Right now you can peruse a selection of sample characters and see what is coming in the
next version of the app.  As new features are added, you will see them here.  At some
point, this will change from 'preview' to 'beta' and you will be able to start adding
and sharing your own characters.</p>

<p>I am very excited about this, and I hope you are too.  Thank you all so much for your
patience and support.</p>

<p>- Ben</p>
